# A _brief_ demo of the KU Community Cluster 

The CRC high performance computing cluster (CRC) at KU is a community cluster that does the heavy lifting of computing for researchers on campus.

Think of a computer cluster as a network of computers with one computer acting as a mastermind (`head node`), and the rest being minions (`computing nodes`). The head node is also the entry point - when one logs into the cluster, they log into the head node. Specialized software on the head node manages the workload of the computing nodes.
